    "This section prepares and runs the `xrtpipeline` tool, which is part of the HEASoft suite and automates the entire data reduction workflow for the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT). It processes raw Level 1 data files and outputs cleaned and calibrated Level 2 data products (event files, spectra, light curves, images, etc.) ready for scientific analysis.  \n",
    "The pipeline consists of three logical stages:\n",
    "1. Preprocessing and Calibration: This stage handles the preparation and calibration of raw XRT event files and housekeeping (HK) data.\n",
    "2. Screening of Events: This stage filters the calibrated events based on quality and observational parameters. The result is a clean Level 2 event file, filtered and scientifically reliable.\n",
    "3. Scientific Product Generation: This final stage uses the filtered data to generate science-ready products. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The command is built as a list of arguments, which can later be executed using Python’s `subprocess.run()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `xrtpipeline` runs with the following arguments:  \n",
    "+ `indir`: Specifies the input directory containing the raw observation data. Typically, this is a folder extracted from the Swift data archive.\n",
    "+ `steminputs`: This defines the base filename stem used in the raw data files. For Swift, it's usually sw followed by the observation ID.\n",
    "+ `outdir`: The directory where all processed (cleaned) output files will be saved.\n",
    "+ `srcra`: Right Ascension (RA) of the source in decimal degrees. This is used to center and align data products.\n",
    "+ `srcdec`: Declination (Dec) of the source in decimal degrees. Like RA, it ensures the data is aligned to the correct sky position.\n",
    "+ `createexpomap`:  Instructs the pipeline to generate an exposure map, which is essential for accurate flux estimation.\n",
    "+ `cleanup`: Automatically removes temporary and intermediate files created during processing to save space.\n",
    "+ `clobber`: Allows overwriting of existing output files without prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information and advanced usage, you can refer to the official [xrtpipeline help documentation](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/help/xrtpipeline.html)."

    "**SAOImageDS9** is a astronomical imaging and data visualization tool widely used by astronomers. It allows users to display and analyze FITS images, create and edit region files, overlay multiple datasets, and perform various interactive operations. DS9 supports advanced features such as coordinate grids, scaling, color maps, and region-based filtering, making it an essential tool for preparing and inspecting data before further analysis like spectral extraction.
