    "## Methods for Accessing HEASARC Data  \n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore various methods to access and download data from the HEASARC (High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center) archive. While our focus will be on Swift satellite data, the approaches demonstrated here can be applied to data from any HEASARC-hosted mission. The methods covered in this notebook are adapted from the [sciserver_cookbooks](https://github.com/HEASARC/sciserver_cookbooks) GitHub repository.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Online Access via Swift Master Catalog\n",
    "The Swift Master Catalog is a web-based interface that allows users to browse and download Swift mission data. It provides a user-friendly way to search for observations, view metadata, and download datasets directly through the HEASARC website. This method is ideal for quick, manual queries or exploring the data interactively.  \n",
    "Access the [Swift Master Catalog](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/w3browse/swift/swiftmastr.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. HEASARC TAP Service (Table Access Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "The TAP service is a standardized Virtual Observatory protocol that enables programmatic access to astronomical catalogs and data tables. Through TAP, users can execute SQL-like queries to retrieve data from the HEASARC archives in a flexible and automated manner. This is particularly useful for large-scale data mining, batch queries, or integrating HEASARC data access into software pipelines.  \n",
    "Learn more: [TAP Service](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/20190626/PR-TAP-1.1-20190626.html), [HEASARC API](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/archive/apis.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Xamin's API\n",
    "Xamin is an advanced query and data mining tool provided by HEASARC that supports complex data searches and cross-matching across multiple catalogs. Its API allows users to submit queries programmatically and retrieve data in various formats. Xamin’s capabilities make it a powerful resource for in-depth data exploration and multi-wavelength studies.  \n",
